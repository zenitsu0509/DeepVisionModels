# Handwritten Digit Prediction Model

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Prediction project! This model uses deep learning techniques, including Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to predict handwritten digits. The model takes real-time user input, allowing the user to draw digits on a canvas and predicts the digit with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

This project is built using the MNIST dataset, a standard dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The model is designed to process grayscale images of digits drawn by the user and predict the corresponding digit in real-time. 

### Features
- **Real-Time Prediction:** The model allows users to draw digits on a grey canvas using a black pen, and the model predicts the digit in real-time.
- **Deep Learning Techniques:** Utilizes both traditional Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate prediction.
- **Custom Dataset Training:** The model is planned to be trained on a larger custom dataset, provided in the project folder, for further accuracy improvements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)
## OR   
 you can run directly in google colab
### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/zenitsu0509/DeepVisionModels.git>
   cd <handwritten_digtit>

### Contributions and Feedback
Iâ€™m continuously working on improving the accuracy of the model. Feel free to use the code, play with it, and suggest changes that can enhance the project. Iâ€™m also planning to train the model on a larger dataset for even better performance.

### Future Plans
Training on a larger dataset: I plan to extend the training process to a more extensive custom dataset provided in the project folder.
Accuracy Improvements: Ongoing efforts to optimize the model for higher accuracy.
