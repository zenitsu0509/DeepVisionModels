# Vision Transformer for Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model processes images drawn on a web-based canvas and predicts the corresponding digit. The application consists of a Flask backend serving the model and a simple front-end for user interaction.

## Features

- Draw digits on a web canvas.
- Predict handwritten digits using a Vision Transformer model.
- Clear the canvas to start anew.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for the backend API)
- PyTorch (for building and running the Vision Transformer model)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)
- CORS (for cross-origin requests)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zenitsu0509/DeepVisionModels/handwritten_digtit.git
   cd your-repo
Usage
-----

1.  Run the Flask application:

    bash

    Copy code

    `python app.py`

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3.  Draw a digit on the canvas and click the "Predict" button to see the predicted digit.

4.  Use the "Clear" button to reset the canvas.

API Endpoints
-------------

-   **POST /predict**

    -   **Description**: Predict the digit from the drawn image.
    -   **Request Body**:

        json

        Copy code

        `{
          "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
        }`

    -   **Response**:

        json

        Copy code

        `{
          "prediction": 5
        }`

Model Training
--------------

If you need to retrain the Vision Transformer model, ensure you have the MNIST dataset and follow these steps:

1.  Modify the training script to load the MNIST dataset.
2.  Adjust hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs as needed.
3.  Save the model as `vit_mnist_model.pth` after training.
