# Handwritten Digit Prediction Model

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Prediction project! This model leverages advanced deep learning techniques, including Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately predict handwritten digits. The model is interactive, allowing users to draw digits on a canvas and receive real-time predictions.

## Project Overview

This project is built on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. The model processes grayscale images of digits drawn by users and predicts the corresponding digit with high accuracy in real time.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Prediction:** Users can draw digits on a grey canvas using a black pen, and the model will predict the digit instantaneously.
- **Deep Learning Techniques:** The model integrates traditional Neural Networks and CNNs to achieve high prediction accuracy.
- **Custom Dataset Training:** Future training will involve a larger custom dataset, included in the project folder, to further improve model accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

**Alternatively:** You can run the project directly in Google Colab.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zenitsu0509/DeepVisionModels.git
   cd handwritten_digit
## Contributions and Feedback
Iâ€™m constantly working to enhance the model's accuracy. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with it, and provide any suggestions that could improve the project. Plans are also underway to train the model on a more extensive dataset for even better performance.

## Future Plans
Training on a Larger Dataset: I intend to expand the training process using a more comprehensive custom dataset available in the project folder.
Accuracy Improvements: Continuous efforts are being made to fine-tune the model for higher accuracy.
## Happy Coding ðŸ˜Š
